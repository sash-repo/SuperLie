==============================================
21may03  Version 2.02 released
         The documentation is revised
==============================================

01jun03  New constructor HamiltonAlgebra.

         Regradings of Poisson algebra with integer parameter
         (as for VectorLieAlgebra).

14sep03  CartanMatrixAlgebra: The function PolyGrade was not defined on
         diagonal elements. Fixed. More debug messages added.

         Fixed VSolve to work with single (non-list) unknown and with
         extra (more than 2) arguments.

         Added VerifySolutions->False to Solve[..., InverseFunctions->True]
         (because otherwise it does not work in Mathematica 5.0)

         Fixed "Loaded" messages at the end of  *.m files

30sep03  Changed wrong symbol names
         FactorModule -> QuotientModule (function)
         Factor -> Quotient (option)
         EnveloppingSymbol -> EnvelopingSymbol (function)
         EnveloppingOperation -> EnvelopingOperation (function)

         The functions RDer and ZRDer removed.

12oct03  The default of $SNormal changed from Expand to Together

18oct03  Fixed order of evaluation of relations in case of generators with 
         different or negative gradings.

19oct03  Package Cohom`: new argument of chSetAlg - the module of coefficients
         Added defaults for ch$raise, ch$lower, chSplit.
         chBasis[d] used only if no coef. module defined in chSetAlg
         Function chPos[] returns the current position in the process of calculation.

         Changed InfixFormat (the precedence did not work).
         Group option removed.
         Subscripted output in Standard form made readable.
         Fixed removing format

31oct03  Fixed property Jacobi->{op1,...} so that it is applied to every element of
         the list (that allows using special rules for operations)

07dec03  Changed order of generation of Z-graded algebras, now the graded components
         are calculated consecutively (the old order was by the degree in terms of
         generators). This allow having zero-graded generators.

14dec03  Enhancements in output format

20jan04  Enhanced svSolve

18apr04  New functions for CartanMatrixAlgebra: CartanMatrix, RootReflection,
         WeightToPolyGrade, PolyGradeToWeight (not yet documented)

25apr04  HWModule[m,g,lambda] builds module with highest weight (lambda[1],...,lambda[n]).

==============================================

         basis of monomials

         Fixed Domain of arguments. The form with 3 arguments has now default definition
         via 2-argument form (with second argument First, Last, All). The existing definitions
         op/: Domain[op,All]:=... changed to op/: Domain[op,_]:=... .

28mar05  Option WList to space constructor gives the weigths of generators.

         Fixed LinearCollectRule to work with non-sorted sums.

         Option Clear->True keeps now the list of defined spaces-relatives.

         only for modules built from highest or lowest vectors)

17apr05  New method for function GradeBasis, with a symbol as the first argument.
         GradeBasis[fn, vars, op] defines function fn[deg] => basis of degree deg. This function
         stores intermediary results and therefore is faster if called repeatedly.
